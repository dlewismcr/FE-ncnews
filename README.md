# Northcoders News - Front End

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation website.

It contains articles which are divided into topics. Users can view a preview of all articles, or select by topic, then click on an article to view the full article along with all comments & votes.

Each article & comment has user generated votes, which can be up or down voted by the current user. Each user may only cast one vote per article or comment. Once the vote has been cast, the same button can be used to retract the vote.

Users can add articles to any topic and add comments to any articles. Users also have the ability to delete any comments that they have created.
